I believe one of the most important quality to have is curiosity. I've always been driven by it and believe it is important to learn something every day. However, learning something and then not remembering it several months later and not having anything to find it back can be frustrating.

In order to keep track and see all the things I've learned over the years, I decided to try and catalog the things I learn, read or think about once a day. It will force me to conciously notice what I learned. It might also help retaining that knowledge from writing about it and then having the possibility to revisit it.
