... listened to the episode [You 2.0: Decide Already!](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545097480/you-2-0-why-were-bad-at-predicting-our-own-happiness-and-how-we-can-get-better) of the Hidden Brain podcast on npr. In this episode, Daniel Gilbert from the Harvard University, author of the book [Stumbling on Happiness](https://www.amazon.ca/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/0676978584), explains how the prediction people make about future events are actually not accurate.

Predicting emotion about how things will unfold. Buying a new car = happy but it's just nice. Losing a job = terrible, but it's actually the best thing. We leave things when we think about the future. We leave the fact that our future self is not ourself either. Stumbling On Happiness.
