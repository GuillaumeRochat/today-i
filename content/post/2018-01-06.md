... listened to the episode [You 2.0: Decide Already!](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545097480/you-2-0-why-were-bad-at-predicting-our-own-happiness-and-how-we-can-get-better) of the Hidden Brain podcast on npr. In this episode, Daniel Gilbert from the Harvard University, author of the book [Stumbling on Happiness](https://www.amazon.ca/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/0676978584), explains how the prediction people make about future events are actually not accurate.

Predicting emotion about how things will unfold. Buying a new car = happy but it's just nice. Losing a job = terrible, but it's actually the best thing. We leave things when we think about the future. We leave the fact that our future self is not ourself either. Stumbling On Happiness.

Talk about pick between two choices and then we wonder how could it have been even a choice, they aren't even close and don't see ourselves having chosen the other. Once you chosen one, the mind convinces us that the thing we got is better than the thing we had. (coping/rationalization). Feel better about the world in which we find ourselves.

More freedom = more happiness. But not really right. How can you be less happy with less choice. But sometimes more choice = less happy. Study with black and white photo. They told people that they had to chose one of the two photo they made. One group was told they could change, one that they couldn't change. The group that couldn't change ended up happier about the outcome, while the first group was still stuck wondering if they made the right choice as there was still a choice to be made. They even asked a group people which group they wanted to be in and they all wanted to be in the first group.

When we make an irrevocable decision, the mind rationalize it and convinces us it's the best decision we could have made. Daniel Gilbert was with his girlfriend after the study, and he proposed to her. He says now he loves her even more from it, only because he made the irrevocable commitment.

When we imagine the future, we only focus on one or two element of that future, and ignore all other details that have an impact on our happiness. We should be humble about our prediction as we know we can't imagine all the details.

They also did a study where people had to estimate how much they would change in the future. All people underestimated how much they would change, as opposed to asking 10 years later how much they have changed. It's true for every group of age. Even at 60, they say they won't change anymore, yet at 70 they still realized they have changed a lot.

We don't learn from those prediction, and we are not getting better at predicting the future. It's like an optical illusion, we can't see the future in an accurate way.
