... listened to the episode [You 2.0: Decide Already!](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545097480/you-2-0-why-were-bad-at-predicting-our-own-happiness-and-how-we-can-get-better) of the Hidden Brain podcast on npr. In this episode, Daniel Gilbert from the Harvard University, author of the book [Stumbling on Happiness](https://www.amazon.com/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/1400077427/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=bb5bf5056da1a2bdd9f704f6bf56f9e3&creativeASIN=1400077427), explains how the prediction people make about future events are actually not accurate.

People are not good at predicting emotion about how things will unfold. We always believe that buying a new car will make us happy but it's just "_nice_". We think that Losing a job would be terribly, but it's actually "_the best thing that could have happened_".

Daniel Gilbert explains that when we have to choose between options, once we choose one, we can't believe that we even debated those options. He says that it is because our mind convinces us that the thing we now got is better than the thing we had, that our mind makes us feel better about the world in which we find ourselves. He calls that rationalization.

He says that more freedom does not always mean more happiness. (Is that a Collective Fiction?) He talks about a study in which they taught people how to do black and white photos. At the end of the class, they would tell the students that they could only pick one of two pictures they made. A first group was told that if they changed their mind they could exchange the picture. The second group was told that they could not change their mind, as the other picture would be sent elsewhere. When they got back to the people in the study, the first group was less happy with their choice than the second group, because they still had the option to chose, while the second group rationalized the decision.

They also asked a third group of people in which group they would have prefered to be, and almost everyone would rather be in the first group where they would still have an open choice.

They also did a study where people had to estimate how much they would change in the future. All people underestimated how much they would change. Another group was asked how much they have changed in the past 10 years, it was always much more than they expected 10 years ago. It turned out to be true for every group of age. Even at 60, they said they wouldn't change anymore, yet at 70 they still realized they changed a lot more than expected.

Daniel Gilbert says the best way to predict your future is actually finding people who are that future right now and ask them how it is, but we never listen to that. They created a speed dating clinic in which they told the women that they could either learn all about the men they were about to meet or get told by another women who dated that same person how it was. Then, from what they chose, they'd have to predict how it would go. They would always prefer to be told everything about the guy rather than be told how it was from someone else, as they believed their judgment was better at predicting how things would go, and that they aren't like the others so the experiences of the others don't apply.

We don't learn from those prediction, we are not getting better at predicting the future. It's like an optical illusion, we can't see the future in an accurate way. However, when we can get the experience from someone that is our future self, that person experience is almost always a better prediction than whatever we can imagine, and we should learn from those experiences.
