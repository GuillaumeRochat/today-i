... listened to the episode [You 2.0: Decide Already!](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/21/545097480/you-2-0-why-were-bad-at-predicting-our-own-happiness-and-how-we-can-get-better) of the Hidden Brain podcast on npr. In this episode, Daniel Gilbert from the Harvard University, author of the book [Stumbling on Happiness](https://www.amazon.ca/Stumbling-Happiness-Daniel-Gilbert/dp/0676978584), explains how the prediction people make about future events are actually not accurate.

Predicting emotion about how things will unfold. Buying a new car = happy but it's just nice. Losing a job = terrible, but it's actually the best thing. We leave things when we think about the future. We leave the fact that our future self is not ourself either. Stumbling On Happiness.

Talk about pick between two choices and then we wonder how could it have been even a choice, they aren't even close and don't see ourselves having chosen the other. Once you chosen one, the mind convinces us that the thing we got is better than the thing we had. (coping/rationalization). Feel better about the world in which we find ourselves.

More freedom = more happiness. But not really right. How can you be less happy with less choice. But sometimes more choice = less happy. Study with black and white photo. They told people that they had to chose one of the two photo they made. One group was told they could change, one that they couldn't change. The group that couldn't change ended up happier about the outcome, while the first group was still stuck wondering if they made the right choice as there was still a choice to be made.
