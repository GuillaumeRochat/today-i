... read [Things I have learnt as the software engineering lead of aÂ multinational by Minnen Ratta](https://minnenratta.wordpress.com/2017/01/25/things-i-have-learnt-as-the-software-engineering-lead-of-a-multinational/). In itself, it is not very different from what I read yesterday, or different than other things I read about in [Implementing Lean Software Development](https://www.amazon.ca/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381). It however brought to my attention how much I've seen on these subjects over the past months.

I am glad to see these things as I do believe there is still a lack of professionalism in software development and repeating those things and trying to improve ourselves at skills other than programming will help greatly. I liked the book [The Clean Coder](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073) but that wasn't nearly enough to make a big difference in the industry.

The thing I am wondering however is whether my impression is right. Is there really more articles and an evolution on the subject, or is it just my personal evolution that draws me more toward these subjects?

I hope the industry is indeed getting better. I see that technically it is getting more and more mature. I will keep working to improve that ecosystem, to internalize as much as I can, and distribute that experience onto colleagues.
