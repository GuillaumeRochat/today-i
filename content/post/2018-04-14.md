... haven't done much in terms of learning per say. I did however do a lot today, and there are some small improvements I'm currently trying to work out. I started germination again, I started practicing the "right method" for typing and I'm trying to fix my shoulders.

Last Fall, I started doing germination. I actually did it for only two weeks before stopping. The goal was to get healthy food on a daily basis from that, maybe by blending it with fruits and juice in the morning to get some vitamins and fibers. I decided to start alfalfa again as it was the only seed I liked the taste off. The process is rather simple : I put one table spoon of seed in a 500 Ml mason jar with room temperature water for 6 hours. Instead of a lid, I put a net with an elastic to hold it. After six hour, I rinsed the seeds and rotated the jar as I was pouring the water out, so the seeds would spread on the jar rather than all stick in the net. Then, I put them at a 45 degree angle to let the water drip and the air flow inside. From there, every morning and every evening I will rinse the seeds with the same method, and about 6 to 8 days later, I will have a full jar of alfalfa to eat. The reason why those germinated seeds are good is because it's during the first few days after a plant starts to grow that it contains the most nutrients.

Regarding typing, I already learned to typing with the right method, but I never got efficient enough to only use this method. The thing that holds me back the most is my pinkies that aren't very agile yet. Since every shift, enter, backspace, control, etc. is typed with the pinkies, it's important that are agile enough to type fast. It's ironic that they need to do the most stretchy moves on a keyboard while also being the most difficult to move. Maybe a keyboard such as the Ergodox would be a better fit and would give a better
