... learned about the [Toyota Product Development System](https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Product-Development-System-Integrating/dp/1563272822). More specifically, I read the history chapter regarding the Lean Software Development from the book [Implementing Lean Software Development](https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1512774544&sr=1-1&keywords=implementing+lean+software+development) by Mary and Tom Poppendieck. As it appears, Toyota is actually from the Toyoda family that developped a strong looming business by automating a lot of the looming process in the early 1900s. When they started in the car industry, they used two principles they learned from the looming industry: automation and just-in-time.

By doing automation, a manufacturer must have loop to handle failures and fix them when needed. It is not entire automation but automating stops in case of failure so the workers can see the issue and fix it. It leads to the concept of [stop-the-line](https://leanbuilds.wordpress.com/tag/stop-the-line/).

By implementing [just-in-time](http://www.brighthubpm.com/monitoring-projects/72086-toyota-and-jit-manufacturing/), a manufacturer ends up not stacking up a big inventory a different points in the chain of production. It also does not try to maximize the production time of every machine used. It instead aims to only do something when something is needed, reducing waste and overburdence.

Eventually, all the methods used by Toyota became the [Toyota Product Development System](https://www.amazon.com/Toyota-Product-Development-System-Integrating/dp/1563272822), which can be applied to software development through the Lean Software Development.
