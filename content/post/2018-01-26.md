... listened to the [Grit](https://www.npr.org/2016/04/04/472162167/the-power-and-problem-of-grit) episode of the Hidden Brain podcast. In this episode, Angela Duckworth talks about the concept of [grit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grit_(personality_trait)), which is defined as "perseverance and passion for long term goals."

She explains how when she was teaching kids, she often had a few students who were very quick to understand what she explained, and some other that had a lot of difficulties to grasp what they were taught. One would assume the first ones would eventually score much better at the end of the year, but she was actually surprised to see that it wasn't the case. She clarifies that by saying that she knew effort matters, but not how much it matters.

From that revelation, she went back to school to study this personality trait. She studied many people in many discipline, from spelling bee contestant to sales representatives. She noticed that the ones who made it through and did the best were not always the smartest but quite often the grittiest. She believes grit is made of up four key psychological assets: interest, practice, purpose and hope.

Then eventually compare the concept of grit with the concept of [10,000 hours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outliers_(book)), where the grit makes those hours more worthy. One key point of grit, and the 10,000 hours is that the time spent is what is qualified as [deliberate practice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Practice_(learning_method)#Deliberate_practice), a practice that's highly focused on getting better and learning through difficult tasks.
