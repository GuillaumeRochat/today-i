... learned about collective fiction, and more specifically about the collective fiction in the software industry. [Zwischenzugs](https://zwischenzugs.com/) presented that in his post ["My 20-Year Experience of Software Development Methodologies"](https://zwischenzugs.com/2017/10/15/my-20-year-experience-of-software-development-methodologies/) where he describes the concept of collective fiction from the book [Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ICN066A/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00ICN066A&linkCode=as2&tag=grochat-20&linkId=eb79e3d73533b0340961a6bd1b48f3f9) but applied to the software development methodologies.

The concept of collective fiction seems to nicely apply to the software development methodologies. Over the last year, I spent a good deal of time helping with the re-organization the company I work for, and what I learned and saw over the last year is in line with what the author notices. Most (all?) of the methodologies are collective fictions that we use to know how to communicate and work with each other at bigger scale, yet they don't actually reflect the reality.

The comments on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=15830782) eventually lead me to read of the subject of [Kepner-Tregoe](http://begrip.be/kepner-tregoe-analysis/), an analysis process that aims to find the best solution to a given problem, with the least negative effects. This seem to be a very interesting way to solve problems without involving too much emotions or biais in the process.

It also lead me to learn about the [Kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen) Japenese word which means "change for better". It became used as a term for continuous improvement and is frequently referred to in modern management.
