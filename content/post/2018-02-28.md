... read the second part of [Accounting Made Simple](https://www.amazon.ca/Accounting-Made-Simple-Explained-Pages/dp/0981454224) by Mike Piper. In this part, he talks about the GAAP, which is a framework of accounting created by the Financial Accounting Standards Board. Publicly traded companies are forced to follow the GAAP guidelines by the Securities and Exchange Commission, but are quite often used by non-publicly traded companies as well.

**Double-Entry Accounting**

He starts off by explaining the concept of **double-entry accounting**. It's quite simple: each transaction results in two entries being made. It does with **debits** and **credits** transactions on the accounts. The two terms a used to express two halves of each transactions, the debit being on the left and the credit on the right. Usually, we understand debit is decreasing the amount and credit as increasing the amount, but as he explains, it is not exactly like that :

> * A debit entry will increase an asset account, and it will decrease a liability or owner's equity account.
> * A credit entry will decrease an asset account, and it will increase a liability or owner's equity account.

So, they are not exactly as we would first think. It depends on the nature of the account on which the operation occurs. The same goes for incomes and expenses, where the credit is used for an income but the debit is used for an expense.
