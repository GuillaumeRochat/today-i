... learned about the [Cognitive Revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_revolution) that happened in the 1950s while reading the chapter The Informational Turn from [The Information by James Gleick](https://www.amazon.com/Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=e48580357e6f14c74f34f8969f58d5d7&creativeASIN=1400096235). In this chapter, the [Information Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) brought by [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) is said to have been a cause of the Cognitive Revolution.

Claude Shannon created a [mechanical mouse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon#Shannon's_mouse) that could figure its way in a labyrinth, and remember the maze, so as to figure out how to get to any point from wherever. As it appears, it was a sort of brain that could remember things and make decisions based on that.

In psychology, everything was mostly behavioral at that time, which could be described as stimulus and response; given a stimulus, what would the response be. That was based on the work of [Pavlov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ivan_Pavlov). The downside of that approach was that the mind was considered a black box.

With the mechanical mouse, the black box was no longer there, it was out in the open. The mental processes were studied under the information theory light, where the stimulus was just a message, and the receptor of the message the brain. It was combining psychology, computer science and philosophy under one roof.
