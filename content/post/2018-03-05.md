... read and discussed about many finance things. I actually have my mind all over the place reading on so many different subjects. I'll simply put down a few things I want to remember about each things I read/searched/discussed.

I started my morning reading on the subject of [§ 1031](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Revenue_Code_section_1031) which basically is a way to exchange real-estate without paying taxes on the sale. Turns out there's no equivalent in Canada, although an exemption exists for a very narrow case under the [section 44 and 44.1](https://moodysgartner.com/can-canadian-taxpayers-defer-a-gain-on-a-disposition-of-property-by-reinvesting-the-sale-proceeds-like-us-taxpayers-can/). So as it turns out, Canadians are unable to take advantage of 1031 either because the capital gain is to be taxed by Canada anyway and the laws regarding taxation between US and Canada only diminishes the Canadian tax by what the US taxes before. In any case, I'm still not sure how the 1031 would provide so much  advantage in growing assets as opposed to just keeping them where they already sit, even after reading [this](https://www.forbes.com/2010/01/26/capital-gains-tax-1031-vacation-home-personal-finance-robert-wood.html#756b0702f246).

I also found some interesting websites to train in stock market exchange. The two I kept in bookmarks are [How The Market Works](http://www.howthemarketworks.com/) and [Wall Street Survivor](http://www.wallstreetsurvivor.com/). I'll probably get into it while also browsing [ShareWise](https://www.sharewise.com/) to get a feel of the stock market until I have money to invest. This way, I will be learning a few things and make the very first stupid mistakes with fake money rather than real money. Once I move to real money, I'll do more stupid mistakes but that will be a lesson for another time.

I read the chapter about overcoming obstacles in the [Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680003/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=ab72ed8229dbb0b9183b7c8af3a738c8&creativeASIN=1612680003) book by Robert T. Koyisaki. In this chapter, he talks in detail about 5 obstacles :

1. Fear
2. Cynicism
3. Laziness
4. Bad habits
5. Arrogance

He goes in detail about each of these. The fear is mostly the fear of losing money, and he tells us about the Texan way to lose, which is to lose big and be proud of it. He says that winners are those that are not afraid to lose, something I should work on. The cynicism is what he calls Chicken Little, that chicken running around warning about the falling sky. It's the self-doubt, the what-if, that small thing that prevents us from doing something about it. The laziness is about keeping ourselves busy with less important things (I'd call it procrastination). He says the cure for laziness is a little greed. Not too much, just enough to keep you motivated. As for bad habits, he talks about one which is paying others before yourself. He talks about his Rich Dad who always paid himself before others, and then out of fear of not having enough to pay others, he would think harder to figure out how to make enough money to pay them as well. Lastly, arrogance is about lying to yourself and others about things you actually don't know. That many people in finance don't actually know much about what they are saying (is that any different from other fields?) and that it always fail when investing out of arrogance. I don't think that part is an issue for me as I hate grey areas and I am not afraid to say "I don't know" when I truly don't.

Finally, I started reading this [Ultimate Guide to Personal Finance (PDF)](http://iwt.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/guides/ultimate-guide-to-personal-finance/pdf/ultimate-guide-to-personal-finance.pdf). I don't like how it is built at all. The presentation is nice but it really feels empty in content. It's one of those "I'm gonna tell you the secret if you keep reading" but then there's no punch line. Like this part where he says "Get yourself out of credit card debt by negotiating with your bank" and the tip is actually talking them out of some fees but not too often... What's the link? Any way, I'll keep skimming through but I doubt I'll get very much out of it, if not a different point of view on the same subjects.

On a side node, I also talked about Go lang API frameworks, I searched (unsuccessfully) for a generic package manager that could handle versions of git branches automatically in a build process (nothing to do with NPM or anything of the sort, something language generic), and discussed whether doing plugins for applications like Jira would be a viable side gig. You know, the usual day...
