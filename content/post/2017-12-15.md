title = "Disciplined Approach to Problem Solving"

+++
... read the Disciplined Approach to problem solving as specified in [Implementing Lean Software Development by Mary and Tom Poppendieck](https://www.amazon.ca/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381). The Disciplined Approach is basically the scientific process and goes as follow:

1. Define the problem.
2. Analyze the situation.
3. Create a hypothesis.
4. Perform experiments.
5. Verify results.
6. Follow-up/Standardize.

The reason I read this chapter is that I'm in the process of defining a problem and was already starting to analyze the situation and create a hypothesis before even completely defining and confirming the actual problem.

By forcing myself to follow these steps and no go too far ahead, I hope I will be in a position where the problem will be better defined and when the actual needs will appear from that, the hypothesis and the experiments will be better focused and there will be less waste produced.
