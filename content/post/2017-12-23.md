... built and deployed a very basic version of [What's Left](https://whatsleft.netlify.com/). Initially, I tried building with the language [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). The language itself is nice and is purely functional which was something I was looking for. It also has the React/Redux pattern I've been using built in, with the TEA pattern. But, very few resources are available, most libraries I found haven't been updated for over a year, the ecosystem seems to be slowly dying, and [the syntax to write the DOM is horrible compared to JSX](https://github.com/GuillaumeRochat/whatsleft/blob/elm/src/Main.elm#L53-L88).

The goal of What's Left is to see the time that has gone by in a life. It is based on the [Optimistic Nihilism video from Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14) in which he displays the amount of time left with a lot of small dots, saying that someone has 5,200 weeks in his life if he lives to 100, etc. The visual representation he did was very interesting and a nice way to see time progress, rather than age and calendars.

I released a first version where only the difference and displayed with 3 different progress bars, all displaying the same thing in different angles. The overall application is visually horrible, but as I am not big with CSS, it is not something I will be able to fix in an hour.

So, as it is already live, the next step would be to add more numbers and display them more nicely. And to learn some more CSS. This app could then become my Todo List app that I could build with different libraries, frameworks, etc., to learn them.
