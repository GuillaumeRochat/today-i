... built and deployed a very basic version of [What's Left](https://whatsleft.netlify.com/). Initially, I tried building with the language [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/). The language itself seem nice and is purely functional which was something I was looking for. It also has the React/Redux pattern I've been using built in, with the TEA pattern. But, very few resources are available, most libraries I found haven't been updated for over a year, the ecosystem seems to be slowly dying, and the syntax to write the DOM is horrible compared to JSX.
