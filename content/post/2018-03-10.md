... listened to [The Sorting Hat](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/04/568365431/what-can-a-personality-test-tell-us-about-who-we-are) episode of the Hidden Brain podcast. In this episode, they talk about personality test, their accuracy, usefulness, impacts, etc.

The episode starts off with the iconic scene of the very first Harry Potter movie where the Sorting Hat figures out the personality of each new student and places them in the most fitting house. The hat is the test and the house is the result, the personality. Fans of the series ended up learning which house has which traits and in which they fit. They can tell you their friends would be in which house in that universe.

They then go on with the Myers-Briggs test. They tell stories of people who found love from it, who understood better who they are and why they behave the way they do. But they also told stories of people who lost their job because of the result they obtained, of people who lost confidence in themselves because of what the test told them. Someone explained that the second time he took the test, he expected to have the same results, considering he's the same person, but did the opposite on every front. How could that be? He questioned the reliability of the test, and used an alternative instead, the big five personality test.

Eventually, they present someone that made the mix between the Myers-Briggs 16 personalities and the 4 houses in Harry Potter. Turns out, when people who did the Myers-Briggs test were told what they corresponding house were, it matched. So, is the Myers-Briggs scientific and robust enough if its results can be replicated in the houses of a fictional story?

They eventually move on to an entirely different personality concept, the Chinese zodiac. In China, it is believed that the children of the dragon will be doing a lot of great things. They will be better than their parents, will go farther in school. So, every year of the dragon, the birth rate increases
