... received the book [Deep Work by Cal Newport](https://www.amazon.ca/Deep-Work-Focused-Success-Distracted/dp/1455586692) and I started reading it. I haven't got far enough yet to talk much about it. The only thing I can say is that the subject is introduced from anecdotes about authors, psychologist, computer scientists, etc., that have been doing pretty much what Cal Newport describes as Deep Work.

As I read the book, I decided to try to change my behavior at the same times. As I already said, I tried many times to do daily meditation but always stopped about a week or two. I also tried removing negative behavior, rather than adding new one, expecting that out of boredom I would add new better behavior. Those negative behaviors are things like browsing Facebook, Hacker News, Youtube, etc. 

There is also the fact that  this daily blog has so far been the thing I stick to the most. So, in order to change some of my behaviors and succeed at it, I decided to commit by updating a page on this blog daily, with whether I succeeded at each habit I want to change. I do not know whether I should count those behaviors in my daily post reward as well, so I'll reflect on that as I try it.

The goals are :

* No Facebook, Youtube, Hacker News, etc.
* Meditation for 15 to 30 minutes.
* One podcast episode.
* Half hour of reading.
