... started reading another chapter of [Moonwalking With Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=ed04a2458b6b056f6788ee21e5ceb646&creativeASIN=0143120530) by Joshua Foer. In this chapter, he talked about methods to memorize things faster, and the difficulties he had while trying to get ready for a memory competition.

The first thing he talked about was the [Major System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mnemonic_major_system) used to remember digits. The concept is that consonants are associated to digits. When a number is to be remembered, the consonants can form words with vowels being whatever fits. This way, groups of numbers become words that can then be remembered more easily than numbers. For instance, under that system, 32 would be MN, which could be "man". The number 127 would be TNK which could be remembered as "tank". This method however isn't used in competition as it is too slow.

They then go on to the method actually used in competition, the Person-Action-Object method or PAO for short. The concept of PAO is to take each number between 0 and 99 and associate a person doing an action with an object. For instance, they cites 32 being Michel Jackson doing the moonwalk with a white glove. Another number, say 42, could be David Beckham kicking a soccer ball. And 88 could be Bart Simpson writing on a chalk board. When the number 324288 has to be remembered, it takes the person of the first pair, the action of the second pair, and the object of the third pair to form Michael Jackson kicking a chalk board.

They explain that the best mnemonist use this technique from 0 to 999
