... read the last 5 principles of the [Seven Principles of Lean Software Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_software_development#Lean_principles). 

The third one is _Create Knowledge_. The key take away from this part is that the code is the actual knowledge of the software, not the specifications or requirements. The actual code is the knowledge and to empower this knowledge, the development cycle should be short with a constant feedback loop.

The myth against it would be that predictions create predictability, but as we all know, in the software world, you can never predict how things will go, how long it will take, what the final result will be. It would be like planning a painting.

The fourth one is _Defer Commitment_. Although, it does not mean not to make decision, but it means to make **irreversible** decisions to the last minutes, and until then, keep making the code flexible to keep options on how things will be done. It would be like locking yourself with MSSQL and using built-in features versus deciding to not choose how to store data and just keep them in a text file until it's time to choose how to store the data.

The myth is about the way we could believe that planning equals commitment. But planning is not commitment. A plan should be flexible and should be ready for changes along the way.

The fifth one is to _Deliver Fast_.
