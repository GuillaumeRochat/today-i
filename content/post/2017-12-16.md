... want to write about [Optimistic Nihilism as explained by Kursgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14&t=169s). It is how I've been thinking for a long time, but they explain it so much better than I ever could. 

I started thinking this way in High School, after reading some Plato, starting to think about the infinite (nothing gets created out of thin air therefore the universe has always been, so the concept of everything has a beginning and an end is not literal but figurative...), and how my life, or its absence, would affect my life, and the universe.

I came to the conclusion that since nothing ultimately matter in the big scheme of things, I might as well just enjoy the time I have. The difficult part to explain for me is how ultimately nothing matters and how the absence of my life would not have impacted anyone (had I never been born, no one would miss me, as they would not have known me, and neither would I miss not being alive, as I wouldn't have been alive to know it and miss it...).

Kursgesagt explains it very nicely by showing the timeline of the universe, the timeline of our life, and how there is nothing more after than before we were alive. But rather than focusing on this nihilistic vision, he points out the fact that the bad things won't matter in the end, and that we might as well enjoy life while it lasts.
