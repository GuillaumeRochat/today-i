... want to write about [Optimistic Nihilism as explained by Kurzgesagt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBRqu0YOH14). It is how I've been thinking for a long time, but he explains it much better than I ever could. I will however still try to explain how I got to that.

I started thinking this way in High School, after reading some Plato, starting to think about the infinite (nothing gets created out of thin air therefore the universe has always been or is from something that has always been, so the concept of everything having a beginning and an end is not literal but figurative...), and how my life, or its absence, would affect my life, and the universe (the people in it, and everything).

I came to the conclusion that since nothing ultimately matter in the big scheme of things, I might as well just enjoy the time I have. The difficult part to explain for me was how ultimately nothing matters as well as how the absence of my life would not have impacted anyone (had I never been born, no one would miss me, as they would not have known me, and neither would I miss not being alive, as I wouldn't have been alive to know it and miss it, and therefore it doesn't matter how I live it, because eventually that's the state the universe will be in, etc.).

Kurzgesagt explains it very nicely by showing the timeline of the universe, the timeline of our life, and how there is nothing more after than before we were alive for us, that infinity is instantaneous. Rather than focusing on the nihilistic vision, he points out the fact that the bad things won't matter in the end, and that we might as well enjoy life while it lasts. That since nothing matter, our life is the only thing that matter and that we get to dictate the purpose of the universe.
