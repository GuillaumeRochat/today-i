... read the first part of [Accounting Made Simple](https://www.amazon.ca/Accounting-Made-Simple-Explained-Pages/dp/0981454224) by Mike Piper. In this part of the book, he talks about the Financial Statements and the basics of accounting. In order to help remember, I'll write down the important parts down.

###### The Accounting Equation

There are 3 variables in this equation, the **Assets**, the **Liabilities** and the **Equity**. The Assets are what we own, the Liabilities are the debts, and the Equity is a plug figure, the left over after paying of the debts. The equation goes as follow :

    assets = liabilities + equity

However, it is often easier to understand it as :

    assets + liabilities = equity

###### The Balance Sheet

The balance sheet is basically the financial situation at a given point in it. If you were to get one for today, it only tells you what your finances look like at this very moment. It is the formal presentation of the Accounting Equation.

He also explains that the assets can consist of :

* Cash and Cash Equivalents
* Inventory
* Account receivable
* Property, equipment

He does the same for liabilities :

* Accounts payable
* Notes payable

And so does he for the equity :

* Common stock
* Retained earnings

He insists on the difference between **Current** and **Long-Term**, usually Current being assets or liabilities that will be converted to cash within 12 months, while Long-Term will last longer.

He also explains how you can do **multiple-period balance sheets** to see the difference between multiple points in time.

###### The Income Statement

The income statement consists of a statement of the incomes and expenses over a period of time. So, in contrast to the balance sheet, which is at a point in time, the income statement shows the ins and outs of money between balance sheets.

He mentions the **gross profit**, which consists of the **revenues** minus the **cost of goods sold**. He also explains the difference between **operating** incomes/expenses and the **non-operating** incomes/expenses.The difference is kind of self-explanatory, the operating consisting of consistent costs and incomes (rent, salaries), and the non-operating for special events (lawsuit settlement).

###### The Statement of Retained Earnings
