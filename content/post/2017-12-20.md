... read about [Little's Law ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little%27s_law)within [Queuing Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queueing_theory). Little's Law goes as follow:

> the long-term average number _L_ of customers in a [stationary](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stationary_process "Stationary process") system is equal to the long-term average effective arrival rate _Î»_ multiplied by the average time _W_ that a customer spends in the system.

In other terms, the time it takes to do a cycle is directly impacted by the length of the queue, regardless of the average completion time of elements of that same queue.

In Software Development terms, the more items in the backlog, the longer it takes to do a cycle. As the backlog gets bigger, the backlog management time increases. The less tasks there are to process, the smaller the tasks, the faster they are processed, just like the fast checkout lane at the groceries processes much faster than other lanes.

It has been proven that past 80% utilization of resources, such as pushing as much value as possible over a cycle rather than limiting it to a respectable size, the cycle time dramatically increased. The goal is then to limit the amount of work to be done over a cycle and to reduce the cycle duration to produce value at a good pace.
