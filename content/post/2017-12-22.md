... read about [Event Sourcing](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html). The idea behind this pattern is to save events that describe changes to apply rather than applying changes. From there, if we want to get the data, all we have to do is get the list of events for that data and compute the actual state from all the events.

For instance, say we have an account. An event could be "add 10$ to account X". Then, once we want to get the account, all we have to do is compute the events to obtain the value. That seems overly simplified but imagine it instead with events including diffs between the original model and the transformed model. Then, by computing all events, we have the actual last model.

This pattern allows us to cancel events very easily, or transform events to fix issues to obtain the new result, or to see all the events that happened to cause that state.

One downside is that as there are more and more events being applied to the same model as time goes by, so consulting it means computing more and more every time. Many things could be done for that, such as keeping the computed state in a cache, or consolidating all the events of the previous day to the model every night. This way, the events wouldn't have to be recomputed, or only the last events would have to.
