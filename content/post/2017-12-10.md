title = "Claude Shannon & Alan Turing"

+++
... started reading the chapter Information Theory from [The Information by James Gleick](https://www.amazon.ca/Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235). The chapter starts with [Claude Shannon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Shannon) and [Alan Turing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Turing) both working in Bell Laboratories in 1943. They were not working on the same issues at the time, but they exchanged a bit during lunch times, without knowing what the other was working on there. They exchanged on whether machine can think, before even the transistor was invented.

The chapter then goes on with the contribution Alan Turing did in the field of mathematics, regarding the [Decision Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entscheidungsproblem) where he proved that there existed unsolvable problems which was not believed to exist. Alan Turing was able to show that through what is now known as a [Turing Machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).

It then continues with Alan Turing contribution to solving the Enigma at [Bletchley Park](https://bletchleypark.org.uk/). Interestingly enough, Enigma was based from the [Vigen√®re cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vigen%C3%A8re_cipher) which was itself solved by [Charles Babbage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Babbage) in 1854.
