... listened to [The Scientific Process](https://www.npr.org/2016/05/24/477921050/when-great-minds-think-unlike-inside-sciences-replication-crisis) episode of the Hidden Brain podcast. In this episode, they talk about the [replication crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication_crisis) on psychology studies based on a paper published in 2015. In this paper, Brian Nosek published results from the replication of 100 psychology studies, in which only 39 had the same results.

They took the concept of replication of the scientific method. Given the exact same procedure in the same conditions, the same results should hold. Given two solid apples on a table, cutting each with a knife should always produce four apple parts. Many results published are never replicated, the experiment never done a second time. Replication gives more weight to the results, while non-replication shows the results as being less valid, or even dismissed.

The issue with that is the scientific method does not talk about replication to prove the previous results were not forged, or the scientific was not incompetent, as the media would have shows. Instead, they are a way to add more knowledge on the issue, to add more variables, to give more information to see what it truly is. The replication crisis was a misinterpretation of the replication process.

For instance, they took an experiment about stereotype in which they decided to measure positive stereotype effect. Mostly negative ones are studied, but positive ones probably have an impact too. The study tried to see whether Asian females would do better in math when being primed about the Asians being good in math stereotype as opposed to being primed about the female being bad in math stereotype. The results were conclusively showing that being primed by the Asian stereotype increased math performance from the same participants.

However, several years later,
