... read about the [Five S's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5S_%28methodology%29) in [Implementing Lean Software Development by Mary and Tom Poppendieck](https://www.amazon.ca/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381). The Five S's, also know as 5S, come from 5 Japanese words: Seiri, Seiton, Seiso, Seiketsu and Shitsuke. They are a big part of the [Just In Time manufacturing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just-in-time_manufacturing) as used by Toyota. In english, they have also been translated to 5 words starting with S:

1. **Sort** (Seiri): Sort the stuff used by the team, be it code, workstations, areas, servers. Get rid of every old files, outdated versions, unused code, etc. 
2. **Systemize** (Seiton):  Organize everything logically, in the code, on the servers, etc., so everything has a place and there is a place for everything.
3. **Shine** (Seiso): Clean everything left, the screens, the whiteboards, the papers, etc.
4. **Standardize** (Seiketsu): Add automation and standards so that everything is always up to date and the old, unused and outdated cannot reappear.
5. **Sustain** (Shitsuke): Stay disciplined in keeping everything in order.
