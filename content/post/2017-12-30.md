... read about the difference between explicit and implicit as explained by [withoutboats in Not Explicit](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/2017-12-27-things-explicit-is-not/). His explanation of explicit and what it is not fit with what I understood of explicit versus implicit in the past.

My explanation of these two was actually a lot more based on what implicit it and how I do not what it, and that explicit is the opposite.
