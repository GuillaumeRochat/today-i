... read about the difference between explicit and implicit as explained by [withoutboats in Not Explicit](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/2017-12-27-things-explicit-is-not/). His explanation of explicit and what it is not fit with what I understood of explicit versus implicit in the past.

My explanation of these two was actually a lot more based on what implicit it and how I do not what it, and that explicit is the opposite.

Implicit would be something that has side effects that you need to know from some source external to the code. For instance, a library doing a side effect on some object, such as this [sinon-as-promised](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon-as-promised) library. By doing a simple require of the library after requiring sinon, it automatically adds some methods to the original object. It does not return a new modified object, it literally changes what already exists and cause a side effect on a library. When seen from withoutboats point of view, there is no way to know from the code what it does, you have to read the library documentation, which is external to the source.
