... read about the difference between explicit and implicit as explained by [withoutboats in Not Explicit](https://boats.gitlab.io/blog/post/2017-12-27-things-explicit-is-not/). His explanation of explicit and what it is not fit with what I understood of explicit versus implicit in the past.

My explanation of these two was actually a lot more based on what implicit it and how I do not what it, and that explicit is the opposite.

Implicit would be something that has side effects that you need to know from some source external to the code. For instance, a library doing a side effect on some object, such as this [sinon-as-promised](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sinon-as-promised) library. By doing a simple require of the library after requiring sinon, it automatically adds some methods to the original object. It does not return a new modified object, it literally changes what already exists and cause a side effect on a library. When seen from withoutboats point of view, there is no way to know from the code what it does, you have to read the library documentation, which is external to the source.

Another example of something implicit is when a framework or library uses [Convention over configuration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convention_over_configuration). When it just happens that the framework connect things automagically because their name match, or that the files in distinct folders have the same name and therefore some magic is performed between the classes of the each, it just is implicit and once again requires knowledge external to the source. The development must really understand how the framework functions. Furthermore, when a framework using Convention over configuration, a change to a convention would mean a lot of headache to fix it, probably much more complex than when changing a configuration, where the configuration would just have to change.

These two examples are implicit things I do not like to see in projects. If you need to connect classes together, just force me to do it quickly in a file of my choosing so it will be explicit and someone can understand that they are connected without having to search the library/framework documentation. Force me to give the object that will be transformed and give me a transformed copy rather than doing a side effect.
