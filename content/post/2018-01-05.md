... learned about [WOOP](http://woopmylife.org/) in the [You 2.0: WOOP](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/14/542426391/you-2-0-woop-there-it-is) episode of the Hidden Brain podcast on npr. In this episode, [Gabriele Oettingen, author of Rethinking Positive Thinking](https://www.amazon.com/Rethinking-Positive-Thinking-Science-Motivation/dp/1617230235) explains the concept of WOOP and how to use it to achieve your goals.

The concept of WOOP comes from the realization that Positive Thinking might not be as effective as we first thought. Positive Thinking is about visualizing your wishes and thinking about the positive outcome in expectation that they will become true. [Some studies](http://woopmylife.org/further/) showed that people who were thinking positively were actually realizing less than the people who didn't. It came from the fact that they already obtained a bit of satisfaction from the success simply by visualizing the success. They then invested less energy into reaching their goals and were therefore less successful.

The concept of WOOP does not says to not do Positive Thinking, but to do it with a consciousness about what the obstacles are. WOOP is the acronym for Wish, Outcome, Obstacle and Plan. Wish is to think about what you want to achieve. Outcome is thinking about the best possible outcome that could happen. Obstacle is figuring out what's preventing you from achieving your goal. Plan is to find a way to get past that obstacle if it ever shows up.

The nice thing about WOOP is unlike Positive Thinking, it focused on the potential negatives with plan to react or overcome those negatives. It gives a more reasonable vision of what could happen and isn't just wishful thinking that things will go right. It comes with actual potential actions to reach that goal.
