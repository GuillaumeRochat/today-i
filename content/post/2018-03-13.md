... am reaching my goal of writing down what I learned, thought or read for a 100 days in a row! I've been thinking about what it means, the impacts it has, and where I'm at for the past few days, and want to do a review of what I learned so far.

First of all, I read 7 books since I started this! It's more than I read in the past 5 years! I started with [The Information](https://www.amazon.com/Information-History-Theory-Flood/dp/1400096235/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=e48580357e6f14c74f34f8969f58d5d7&creativeASIN=1400096235) where I learned about the history of information, which starts of with talking drums down to bits. While finishing this one, I read [Implementing Lean Software Development](https://www.amazon.com/Implementing-Lean-Software-Development-Concept/dp/0321437381/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=0a598f7b012d12fbd4875ae0a21b88dd&creativeASIN=0321437381) where I learned about the lean principles, and where it comes from, with the story behind Toyota and the ways to be more efficient. I then moved to [Deep Work](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1455586692/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1455586692&linkCode=as2&tag=grochat-20&linkId=656f46ccb19aebc7272ca0e4e2c18441) to try and be more focused on my work every day. It was a step toward changing habits and focusing on what really matters for my future. The next one was [The Power Of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=98a468dcb70061e9a5f26c9e7b3ce24a&creativeASIN=081298160X) which is a very insightful book. It really changes my perceptions on the action I take and how I can modify my surroundings and behaviors to help me achieve goals without having to put in too much willpower. Next I moved to [Reinventing Organizations](https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Organizations-Frederic-Laloux/dp/2960133501/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=16863a1649df82b5cc3f9efbc9aa1103&creativeASIN=2960133501) which I just finished. This book is great to see something greater than how we work today. It made me think not just about how organizations are working and could be better, but how I, as an individual, have an impact on how things work. It's the collective perception and changing my own is important to be able to be in an outstanding organization. While reading that last book, I also quickly went through [Accounting Made Simple](https://www.amazon.com/Accounting-Made-Simple-Explained-Pages/dp/0981454224/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=610acf5675e1a4afee40bc3583078bb2&creativeASIN=0981454224) to quickly learn the basics and know what I'm looking at while doing my own personal accounting. Once that one was done, I also read [Rich Dad Poor Dad](https://www.amazon.com/Rich-Dad-Poor-Teach-Middle/dp/1612680003/ref=as_sl_pc_tf_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=ab72ed8229dbb0b9183b7c8af3a738c8&creativeASIN=1612680003) in no time. It really gave me another outlook to money handling in general and made me want to reach a point of independence from work in order to make enough money to live. I'm still ambivalent on the subject as it makes me feel more like an achiever in terms of money and might actually be conflicting and making me lose sight of the bigger picture. Nevertheless, it is good to change my perception of money. And with all this, I also started reading another book, [The Intelligent Investor](https://www.amazon.com/Intelligent-Investor-Definitive-Investing-Essentials/dp/0060555661/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=1e3e2c9c4983efac6efede93555eb72d&creativeASIN=0060555661).

Just from reading alone, I learned a lot on many different subjects. I do not want to slow that down as I believe it is the best way to learn quickly from many sources. I also spent a lot of time listening to podcasts. I mostly listen the Hidden Brain podcast, with some very interesting psychological studies and facts. It was a very interesting podcast that gave me a lot of insight into human behaviors. It was particularly well suited to listen while reading Deep Work and The Power of Habit. They actually appeared after I listened to the podcast. I also got a list of nice finance podcasts to help me stay on it with finances.

One other aspect that is a side effect of having to write every day is that I also got much better at writing down my ideas. I can easily write down a post in a few minutes and barely have to fix anything. The length of the post also increased. That was expected, but I'm surprised at how quickly it actually changed.

The Plan was also a nice thing. I wanted to change habits and nothing better than posting every day whether you succeeded. It worked really well for the first few weeks. Not a single Fail was written down, it was awesome. But once Fail started to appear, it seemed easier to fail. I still fail from time to time, but I try to have small streaks of successes now and then. My biggest issue is that it sometimes asks too much on a single day and cutting on the sleep is the worst thing to do while trying to do self improvement. So I accept some failures but I always try to fix it right after. My worst failure was a 3 day streak of failing on the chores, and I saw the impact that very same weekend where the dishes got pilled up.

Although I succeeded, I decided not to buy a Google Home because of the budget. I'm trying to get rid of my debts and a Google Home is more of a gadget than a tool. I might end up not using it anymore after a couple of weeks, so why bother. Instead, I'll get a Chromecast Audio, so we can cast to the sound system rather than plug our cellphone there. It will be more convenient, mostly for my wife fiddling on her phone while doing her daily bike.

I'm also very happy of all the efforts my wife is putting in. She has been working out almost every day for the past month, it doesn't seem to be as difficult for her. I also haven't notice any friction with her recently, and I believe it has to do with all the efforts and energy I put into improving myself. She takes care of me a lot more as well, I believe because of the daily engagement I made to clean a bit, read a bit, meditate a bit, etc.
