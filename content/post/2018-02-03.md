... started reading [Reinventing Organizations](https://www.amazon.ca/Reinventing-Organizations-Creating-Inspired-Consciousness/dp/2960133501) by Frederic Laloux. More specifically, I read the chapter about the organizational models currently existing. Most of the chapter is from the Red to Green models, but starts off with two models that almost entirely disappeared.

The first model is the **Reactive - Infra-red paradigm**. It coincides with the most early stage of consciousness, before realizing we are distinct from the group. It fits for very small families and was there about 100K to 50K years ago. At this level, there is no leader, no role, no division of labor, everyone does the same thing to survive.

The second model is the **Magic - Magenta paradigm**. It was there around 15K years ago and coincides with the distinction of the self from the group, but still without much roles or leaders. It fits the size of tribes, with shamans or elders. In this stage, people live mostly in the present with some knowledge of the past.

The third model is the **Impulsive - Red paradigm**. It's the first form of organization that appeared 10K years ago. The self is fully detached from the group and the world, a realization that is frightening. It makes the world feel dangerous and people must be strong and tough to fulfill their needs. Showing power is the way to go, the strongest is at the top. It's the organizational model of the mafia, prisons, civil wars.

The fourth model is the **Conformist - Amber paradigm**.
