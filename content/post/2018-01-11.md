... did plenty but not much worth talking about. I started the day with the [Compassion](https://www.npr.org/2015/10/20/448075446/the-science-of-compassion) episode of the Hidden Brain podcast on npr. The episode basically talks about the power of compassion. They state that by simply consciously thinking about everyone involved in what we use and consume, we would be more kind and that kindness is actually contagious.

Then, over the day, I tried to implement the concepts of CQRS in the Proof of Concept I am doing. I initially did without it and quickly ended up having to insert a bunch of code to handle the difference between the read and the write in the whole back end. Turns out we can really split how the read and write work so they each have their own stack and behavior adapted to what they have to do.

Then I went to do some bouldering and haven't learned much since then... Oh well, it was more of a do day then a think/learn day.
