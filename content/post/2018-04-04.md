... read The Most Forgetful Man In The World chapter of the [Moonwalking With Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=ed04a2458b6b056f6788ee21e5ceb646&creativeASIN=0143120530) by Joshua Foer. In this chapter, the author goes to the opposite of memory but exploring the extreme of forgetfulness. Most of the chapter is about the man known as EP in psychology. I already mentioned him from The Power of Habit where his case was used to understand habits more thoroughly.
