... read The Most Forgetful Man In The World chapter of the [Moonwalking With Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=ed04a2458b6b056f6788ee21e5ceb646&creativeASIN=0143120530) by Joshua Foer. In this chapter, the author goes to the opposite of memory but exploring the extreme of forgetfulness. Most of the chapter is about the man known as EP in psychology. I already mentioned him from The Power of Habit where his case was used to understand habits more thoroughly. In this chapter however, they spend a lot more time figuring out how memory works, all the different types of memory there is, etc.

First of all, they specify two distinct categories of memory, the declarative memory and the nondeclarative memory. The first category is what we consciously know such as the categories of memory, and the second category is what we don't know we know, such as how to ride a bike. The distinction is important because cognitively, they don't pass through the same process. As we learned in The Power of Habit, the nondeclarative memory can still form in someone that can no longer learn anything new due to brain damage.

Of the second category, there exists two types, the semantic memory, and the episodic memory. The distinction is rather simple. Semantic memory is about facts such as breakfast is the first meal of the day. Episodic memory is about events, such as what I ate for breakfast. The distinction is important because only episodic memory is linked to time, and apparently that causes them to go through a different neural pathway than semantic memory.

The most interesting reflection there was regarding memory through this chapter has to do with episodic memory.
