... stumbled upon [Reason](https://reasonml.github.io/) by Facebook which they use for their Messenger web app (not the Android/iOS). It's a syntax toolchain that basically lets you code in OCaml and then transform that to JS or something along those lines.

Then I decided to check again about purely functional language for frontend development. I already had heard of [Elm](http://elm-lang.org/) a bit, but I didn't know what the whole ecosystem looked like. Turns out that there are many alternatives currently available, Elm being the most popular one.

There is, first of all, a [javascript eslint config](https://github.com/bodil/eslint-config-cleanjs) that forces to use only purely functional constructs, such as no if, no this, no class, etc. Then there is Elm. Next is [PureScript](http://www.purescript.org/) which is a new language on its own that transpiles to JS and is based of [Haskell](https://www.haskell.org/) syntax wise. Finally, there is [GHCjs](https://github.com/ghcjs/ghcjs) which is pretty much the Haskell compiler to JS.

Based on [this post comparing all possible choices from Mutanatum](http://mutanatum.com/posts/2017-01-12-Browser-FP-Head-to-Head.html), the most opinionated yet mature solution is Elm, with PureScript being a good contender to become the next big purely functional language, and GHCjs having a lot of possibilities in terms of how to build your frontend stack.

That being said, as I have no experience with purely functional languages, I'm tempted to try Elm first on a small project. Haskell always seemed interesting to me but I never had a project in mind that could be built using a new language with a very different paradigm.
