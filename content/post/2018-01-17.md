... tried the [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/) graph database using their [docker container](https://hub.docker.com/_/neo4j/). I was impressed at how light the image actually was and how easy it was to start a test version of the database.

As soon as you boot the database, you can open a GUI that allows you to query the database, basically the equivalent of a MySQL CLI. They also added within a lot of nice helper methods that run you through the application and help you get introduced to the concept of graph database. For instance, they have a page with an hello world and many small scripts that allow you to start learning about their system. The GUI is very nice as it allows you to actually see the graph of data you are querying and consult it in different format. There seem to be a lot of utilities including statistics about the database, watching queries, managing users, accesses and configs, and exchanging scripts.

I still haven't had much time to dabble into the concept of a graph DB though. On the first look, it seem like any node you add is a single entry with its own structure.
