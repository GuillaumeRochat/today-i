... listened to the [Think Fast with Daniel Kahneman](https://www.npr.org/2018/03/12/592986190/daniel-kahneman-on-misery-memory-and-our-understanding-of-the-mind) episode of the Hidden Brain podcast. In this episode, they meet with Daniel Kahneman, Nobel prize winner and a huge inspiration for the several studies covered by the Hidden Brain podcast.

In the episode, Danial Kahneman talks about 3 subjects.

Experiencing self versus remembering self. Study with colonoscopy. Easier to see the world as understandable. Mind is created to make sens of things. We can't predict the future for real. But the pattern allow us to be right almost all the time. Example of how we to work the intuition with an interview method.

plans for vacations, destroy picture and give amnesic drug. would you change vacations? many would because they go on vacation to create memories. The remembering self makes decisions.

Same made with how happy parents feel. When asked at a moment to moment thing it was different than asked as a whole. People remember the peak moments, which is what makes it worthwhile. It changes the meaning of the experience. People have more fun with friends than with spouses. Typically, people try to maximize the happyness of the remembering self, rather than the experiencing self, which would make us more social, ambitious, spend more time with people we like and enjoy. But the remembering self is stronger.
