... listened to the [You 2.0: Deep Work episode of the Hidden Brain podcast](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/25/539092670/you-2-0-the-value-of-deep-work-in-an-age-of-distraction). In this episode, they talk about Deep Work with Cal Newport, author of the book [Deep Work](by Cal Newport). As I understand it, Deep Work is the action of being deeply focused on the work we are currently doing, cut from distractions.

Cal Newport explains that most people, even when they believe they are not multitasking, are in fact not being focused on a single task either, as they are doing a lot of "_just checks_" every now and then. "I'll just check my inbox real quick." He explains that those brief checks have a much more negative impact than we think. He cites a [study by Sophie Leroy](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597809000399) in which that negative impact is called "Attention Residue", and says that this attention residue takes much longer than we would expect to clear out. It only takes a quick glance to cause that attention residue.

He says that as he was writing the book, he learned from many sources that people engaged in Deep Work are more satisfied about their work. I really believe it is true, although I only have anecdotes to defend my point. I know the days I come home and feel the most accomplished are days where I was able to focus on a problem and code all day with little to no interruption. On the other hand, days where I'm clearing through lists of things to do, talking with X and Y to try to get something started, starting a bit of this and that because I have so many things to do, I never have that same feeling of accomplishment.

Cal Newport goes on to compare Deep Work with [Flow](https://www.amazon.ca/Flow-Psychology-Experience-Mihaly-Csikszentmihalyi/dp/0061339202) and [Mindfulness](https://www.mindful.org/meditation/mindfulness-getting-started/). As I do not know Flow, I wasn't really following this part of the podcast. Regarding Mindfulness, Cal Newport says that Deep Work is similar on the fact that it takes practice to become good at it.

The concept of Deep Work, being highly focused on the task at hand, is well known in manual work. Artisans all know that you cannot do your best work with a lot of distraction. You need to be focused to not make mistakes. In manual work, the impact of being highly focused is also more noticeable, as opposed to information jobs. So, it comes easy to do emails and react to notifications, and interact with the coworkers, to do "_shallow work_". Workers feel busy. I feel busy. But is that good value production? Our brain is the main value production resource, and by not staying deeply focused, we are denying it its potential.

I could not help but compare it to what I have been trying to do for the past weeks. I've been trying to learn [Getting Things Done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done) and to do it truly. I noticed I did forget less things, but I also feel I am not getting any better at producing value, I'm just omitting less things in general. I still believe I should keep working on it and try to get better at the Organize and Reflect part of GTD. But I also have the impression I am doing more shallow work, although it might just be an impression, as I have no empiric way to measure that.

Another concept to mind was the [Pomodoro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique) technique I tried in the past. I believed that following that routine would help me hammer down tasks rapidly by forcing myself to do things in sprints of 25 minutes with small breaks of 5 minutes. The concept did work up to a point. I would always take breaks of a little more than 5 minutes and would often be focusing longer than 25 minutes. I then moved to the [52/17](https://www.themuse.com/advice/the-rule-of-52-and-17-its-random-but-it-ups-your-productivity) technique. It's basically Pomodoro with sprints of 52 minutes with 17 minutes of break. The concept is the same, except that the numbers are taken from statistics collected by [DeskTime](https://desktime.com/). I should either try to do that again, or transform it to instead try to reserve part of my schedule to Deep Work.

One last thing that this subject brought to mind is how I tried repeatedly to do Mindfulness Meditation but could never stick to it for longer than a week or two. For it to work, I would have to develop a habit. I believe I am on the right way with this blog, so maybe I could find a way to commit to doing meditation and deep work consistently.
