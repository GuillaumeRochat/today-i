... spent a lot of time reading all sorts of thing about finances. More specifically, I've been looking at investing and trading a little deeper. I'll list the different subjects I searched today and then I'll summarize my feeling regarding all this.

The first thing I did is register to three different stock market simulators. Basically, they are tools to do fake trades with fake money but using real market data. Not knowing which one would be best to learn, which one would give the most realistic view, I decided to try three : [How The Market Works](http://www.howthemarketworks.com), [Wall Street Survivor](http://www.wallstreetsurvivor.com) and [Investopedia Simulator](https://www.investopedia.com/simulator/home.aspx). Surprisingly, neither How The Market Works nor Wall Street Survivor is on HTTPS, and How The Market Works has some bugs that make me doubt the quality of their platform (as in bugs an intern would catch). Nevertheless, they all three offer the concept of creating a virtual league in which you try to invest from an initial amount with a leaderboard for the league and what not. They all offer some information on how it works, but neither is very clear. Investopedia might be better on this front as they have a lot of public information on everything regarding investment. In terms of UI, it however looks nothing like what I expected...

To find more information, I looked for websites with market data and ways I could track stuff and what not, closer to the real deal. I found [Trading View](https://www.tradingview.com/) and [Share Wise](https://www.sharewise.com/). I haven't spent much time on Share Wise, but it seem to have some decent information. As for Trading View, it offers very detailed charts in which you can add your own formulas to display trends, or you can use any built in or user added formula to better see what's going on. It's a full tool in which you can draw your expectations and do your technical analysis. I'm barely understanding how it works and what I'm looking at, but I can see the potential for a free service while learning. I also looked at other platforms and found one that could be useful while learning, [NinjaTrader](https://ninjatrader.com/). The software can be used for free for simulation, so it might be interesting to try out.

I searched for a lot of podcasts as well. I found several that I decided to bookmark in my Google Play Music, such as [Two Blokes Trading](https://play.google.com/music/m/Im5pedav46jgjcxhzoin32m4cfe?t=Two_Blokes_Trading_-_Learn_to_Trade_Online), [Better System Trader](https://play.google.com/music/m/Ir6i5o5d675daydfpj3mp25jqjy?t=Better_System_Trader),[ Invest Like The Best](https://play.google.com/music/m/Ipf4k4cmloenonfhm6xaui6rsvm?t=Invest_Like_the_Best), [InvestTalk](https://play.google.com/music/m/Irnebyyfyq3tqjikrzzy5pja5yq?t=InvestTalk_-_Investment_in_Stock_Market_Financial_Planning_Retirement_Planning_Money_Management_Podc), and some CNBC ones. I already started listening to Two Blokes Trading, but I was lost maybe half the episode. I spent some time reading on their website as well to try to understand better. They mostly do Forex so most of what they said applied to Forex. They also had information about software to use, brokers to contact, etc. I tried to understand a bit about that broker part. My understanding is that it's the company through which you do the trade and they charge you to do it. NinjaTrader would be a broker. But now we're on the Day Trading part of things, and I'm not sure I want to head that way.

That's a lot of information for a single day, even more so considering I did other things as well. I'm having a hard time understanding where to begin, there are so many things to learn. I'm trying to go about it rationally but my brain keeps bringing me back to browsing many sources. I have a dozen tabs pinned that I want to read, a couple of books aligned, some platforms to try stuff on, and not enough precision in my focus. It means I'm getting a lot of information but it's a lot of unclear noise. I know that considering how the brain works, it'll just kick in soon enough, when the pattern matching figures it out, so I'm not too worried that it doesn't all make sens yet. I'm just worried it's not learning the right stuff.

Considering that I can't invest yet because I have to get rid of liabilities first, I'll learn accounting through that. I do not think I need more on the subject right now, as I have the basics needed to cover my day to day along with some extra knowledge that I'll be able to use later in life. The next step is to learn about investing. Whether I do Day Trading, Swing Trading or Investing later on, I'll still need to understand the markets, how to read a chart, what to look for, where to get news, etc. So while I do the accounting part, I'll stick to learning all these things and maybe failing a couple times virtually. I'm feeling a bit lost with that unorganized information, so I'll try and stick to one platform at a time, not sure which one yet though. Maybe once I know more I'll be able to more clearly illustrate all of it.
