title = "Organizations Assumptions"

+++
... kept reading Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux. I read the first part of the chapter about self-management processes. Rather than writing all I read, I want to write down the part where he explains that most companies have decided to be explicit about usual organization assumptions and what they decided to assume instead.

The first one is assumptions Dennis Bakke wrote about. He's the co-founder of [AES Corporation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AES_Corporation) and was CEO when he wrote this. This first list of what he says owners of a typical factory assume about the workers.

> * Workers are lazy. If they are not watched, they will not work diligently.
> * Workers work primarily for money. They will do what it takes to make as much money as possible.
> * Workers put their own interest ahead of what is best for the organization. They are selfish.
> * Workers perform best and are most effective if they have one simple repeatable task to accomplish.
> * Workers are not capable of making good decisions about important matters that affect the economic performance of the company. Bosses are good at making these decisions.
> * Workers do not want to be responsible for their actions or for decisions that affect the performance of the organization.
> * Workers need care and protection, just as children need the care of their parents.
> * Workers should be compensated by the hour or by the number of "pieces" produced. Bosses should be paid a salary and possibly receive bonuses and stock.
> * Workers are like interchangeable parts of machines. One "good" worker is pretty much the same as any other "good" worker.
> * Workers need to be told what to do, when to do it, and how to do it. Bosses need to hold them accountable.

This second list, is the assumptions he has about the people at AES.

> AES people:
>
> * Are creative, thoughtful, trustworthy adults, capable of making important decisions;
> * Are accountable and responsible for their decisions and actions;
> * Are fallible. We make mistakes, sometimes on purpose;
> * Are unique; and
> * Want to use our talents and skills to make a positive contribution to the organization and the world.
