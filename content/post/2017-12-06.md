... learned about the concept of Muda (waste), Muri (overburden) and Mura (unevenness) from [Toyota](http://blog.toyota.co.uk/muda-muri-mura-toyota-production-system).

The principle stands on eliminating waste (Muda), which Toyota divides in 7 resources that are frequently wasted : transportation, inventory, motion, waiting, over-processing, over-production and defects.

For the overburden part (Muri), the point is that no-one should be overworked. One quote I saw was "Do you push your computer to use the CPU at 110%" and the answer is always "no, because then my computer is unusable". The same concept applies to people, so we shouldn't be pushed too far and asked too much.

Lastly, the unevenness (Mura) is about have a constant flow on things to do rather than downtimes and uptimes. During downtimes, we add waste from waiting. During uptimes, we add overburdence.
