... read yet another chapter of [Moonwalking With Einstein](https://www.amazon.com/Moonwalking-Einstein-Science-Remembering-Everything/dp/0143120530/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=grochat-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=ed04a2458b6b056f6788ee21e5ceb646&creativeASIN=0143120530) by Joshua Foer.

He starts the chapter by talking about Socrate again, who was against writing because it was only teaching forgetfulness. I still believe it had some good effect, mostly adding new ways to think with abstractions and what not, as well as keeping knowledge through generations. They explain that although writing had been invented, for several hundred years, everything was written in a single block, no space, no punctuation, nothing to help distinguish the words. It was just a long stream of capital letters to form sounds. People would actually read aloud because they had to heard the sound to know what was written. It was considered more a learning tool, to help memorizing, than anything else.

They also talk about how before printing was a thing, people were reading in order to remember, while now we just read as much as we can. Since books were rare, people put quality in their reading, rather than quantity. They couldn't read the same book twice, considering how rare they were, so that had to remember as much as possible. In opposition, today we have people paying to learn how to read faster and claim it's alright to not know what you read 50% of the time.

They also talked about a bunch of inventor that tried to recreate the mind palace, not just virtually but physically, as well as people teaching memory tricks and what not. Of all those,
