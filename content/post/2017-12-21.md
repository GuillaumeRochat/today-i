... learned about [Deming's 14 Points](https://deming.org/explore/fourteen-points). [W. Edwards Deming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._Edwards_Deming) was a management consultant among other things. He was best known for helping Japan rose from its ashes after the second World War, in the 1950 and 1960, with his ideas around management. He was best known in America for his 14 points that go as follow :

> **1.** Create [constancy of purpose](https://blog.deming.org/2015/09/create-constancy-of-purpose/ "Constancy of Purpose") toward improvement of product and service, with the aim to become competitive and to stay in business, and to provide jobs.
>
> **2.** Adopt the new philosophy. We are in a new  economic age. Western management must awaken to the challenge, must  learn their responsibilities, and take on leadership for change.
>
> **3.** [Cease dependence on inspection to achieve quality](http://blog.deming.org/2012/11/inspection-is-too-late-the-quality-good-or-bad-is-already-in-the-product/ "Inspection is Too Late"). Eliminate the need for inspection on a mass basis by building quality into the product in the first place.
>
> **4.** End the practice of awarding business on the basis of price tag. Instead, [minimize total cost](https://blog.deming.org/2016/06/minimize-total-cost/ "Minimize total cost"). Move toward a [single supplier for any one item](https://blog.deming.org/2015/05/the-importance-of-working-with-suppliers-over-the-long-term/ "Single supplier"), on a long-term relationship of loyalty and trust.
>
> **5.** [Improve constantly and forever the system of production and service](https://blog.deming.org/2017/07/haircuts-and-continuous-improvement/ "Improve Constantly"), to improve quality and productivity, and thus constantly decrease costs.
>
> **6.** [Institute training on the job.](https://blog.deming.org/2016/03/institute-training-on-the-job/ "Institute Training")
>
> **7.** [Institute leadership](https://blog.deming.org/2016/03/institute-leadership/ "Institute leadership") . The aim of supervision should be to help  people and machines and gadgets to do a better job. Supervision of  management is in need of overhaul, as well as supervision of production  workers.
>
> **8.** [Drive out fear](https://blog.deming.org/2013/02/where-there-is-fear-you-do-not-get-honest-figures/ "Drive out fear"), so that everyone may work effectively for the company.
>
> **9.** [Break down barriers](https://blog.deming.org/2016/08/break-down-barriers-between-departments/ "Break down barriers")  between departments. People in research, design, sales, and production  must work as a team, to foresee problems of production and in use that  may be encountered with the product or service.
>
> **10.** [Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets](https://blog.deming.org/2016/04/eliminate-slogans-exhortations-and-targets/ "Eliminate slogans, exhortations, and targets")  for the work force asking for zero defects and new levels of  productivity. Such exhortations only create adversarial relationships,  as the bulk of the causes of low quality and low productivity belong to  the system and thus lie beyond the power of the work force.
>
> 1. Eliminate work standards (quotas) on the factory floor. Substitute leadership.
> 2. Eliminate management by objective. Eliminate management by numbers, numerical goals. Substitute leadership.
>
> **11.** [Remove barriers that rob the hourly worker of his right to pride of workmanship](https://blog.deming.org/2017/08/the-value-of-dignity-in-work-give-or-take-6-minutes-2/ "Remove barriers"). The responsibility of supervisors must be changed from sheer numbers to quality.
>
> **12.** Remove barriers that rob people in management  and in engineering of their right to pride of workmanship. This means,  inter alia, [abolishment of the annual or merit rating](https://blog.deming.org/2013/02/the-idea-of-performance-rating-to-capture-merit-is-alluring/ "abolishment of the annual or merit rating") and of [management by objective](https://blog.deming.org/2016/07/my-first-trip-to-japan-by-peter-scholtes/ "management by objective").
>
> **13.** Institute a [vigorous program of education and self-improvement](https://blog.deming.org/2014/09/deming-today-leander-texas-independent-school-district/ "A vigorous program of education and self-improvement").
>
> **14.** Put everybody in the company to work to accomplish the transformation. [The transformation is everybody's job](https://blog.deming.org/2017/04/the-transformation-is-everybodys-job/ "The transformation is everybody's job").
