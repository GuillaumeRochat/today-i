... read the Mind Your Own Business and The History And The Power of Corporation of the [Rich Dad Poor Dad](http://www.lequydonhanoi.edu.vn/upload_images/S%C3%A1ch%20ngo%E1%BA%A1i%20ng%E1%BB%AF/Rich%20Dad%20Poor%20Dad.pdf) book by Robert T. Kiyosaki. These are the third and fourth lessons taught in the book.

The Mind Your Own Business chapter focuses on one pretty simple and straight forward concept : know what business you are in and focus on it. What he means by that is to understand that your business is actually not what your profession is. I might be a programmer, but that's just what I learned to do. I'm not in the programming business to build my assets. My skill has to do with the business of my employer. When I take my money and invest it, that's my business. To illustrate that concept, he talks about the founder of McDonald's who always said that he was in the real-estate business, not the hamburger business. All he was focusing on was the location of the properties that would be bought by people who wanted the franchise banner. To quote a previous CFO : 

> we are not technicallyÂ in the food business. _We are in the real estate business_.  The only reason we sell fifteen-cent hamburgers is because they are the  greatest producer of revenue, from which our tenants can pay us our rent.
