... spent the day at the hospital, and ended up wondering about the Value Stream map of hospital in the area. In hospital, you never are considered a "Client" but rather a "Patient". I believe that simple thing changes how employees interacts with their client. The saying is "the client is always right", but that does not apply for patients. Is it part of the reason why we are referred to as patients?

Then, I spent some times thinking about how the value stream is. The goal of the hospital should be to treat the clients as quickly as possible, to reduce the time between the client asking for service and getting that service fulfilled.

The day went as followed:

* We arrived at about 9h30, asked to be registered at the emergency, and got told to get a ticket for triage.
* We went to take a ticket and waited less than 5 minutes for triage.
* We spent no more than 2 minutes in triage to tell about the issue and then get redirected to the registration desk.
* We updated our contact information and then went to wait for our turn.
* We went to get lunch at about 12h30.
* We searched for a drug store to get Tylenol at about 14h15
* We got told that we had to go ask at the emergency as there was no drug store.
* We then got told that in order to get Tylenol, we would have to go through triage again.
* We took a ticket at 14h30 and waited for about 30 minutes before being called for triage.
* We spent 2 minutes doing all the steps in the triage again and got 2 Tylenol.
* We returned to wait in the room.
* We went to the information desk at 17h30 to check if they still had our file open as it had been 8 hours already.
* We got called at 18h00 to go see the doctor.
* We spent no more than 2 minutes explaining the issue, getting checked, and tacking the prescription.
