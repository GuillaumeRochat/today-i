He also hints at it being about more than the individuals. A 100x engineer as he explains it would still have a difficult time in an unhealthy team. But a good team would allow him to shine and would build on that.

I believe that there indeed are people able to produce value much faster than others, but those are in the right team and learned the right skills. I see a link between the 10x/100x and the 10,000 hours concepts; a highly experienced person can solve problems much faster than others.
