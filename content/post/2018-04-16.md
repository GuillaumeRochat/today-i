... mostly tried to program using the right method of writing on a keyboard. The pinkies are hurting still, the arms tired of practicing so much on those fingers that usually are barely used. 

I'm actually debating whether it actually good to use the pinkies for programmers. The way keyboards are designed,  the most used keys are in the middle of the keyboard, and the least used keys outside. What it does however is that the only finger that can reach the least used keys are the pinkies. All other more agile fingers are stuck on the middle where you would only get a-zA-Z0-9.
