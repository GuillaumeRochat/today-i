... listened to the [Google at Work](https://www.npr.org/2016/06/07/480976042/how-googles-laszlo-bock-is-making-work-better) episode of the Hidden Brain podcast. In this episode, they talk about how Google handles the people within the organization. Laszlo Bock, author of [Work Rules!](https://www.amazon.com/Work-Rules-Insights-Inside-Transform-ebook/dp/B00MEMMVB8/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1423767873), is trying to explain how to take people and make them exceptional.

He starts off by talking about how Bell Labs built their new buildings in the 40s or 50s with very long corridors with offices along. Whenever someone would stumble out of their office, they would bump on other employees and new conversations and topic would emerge. Similarly, Google has long tables and large round tables so when people go eat, they often sit next to someone they don't know and conversation can emerge from that.

He then explains that most of what they do start with the assumption that people are fundamentally good. They believe good people do way better and are more careful when they feel like they work on something they own. That's why they still give parts of the company to every employee. They also believe that with it comes the responsibility of being transparent about what's going on. If it's yours, you should know what's going on with it. They do all-hands every week and any one can bring any topic to discuss at those times.

They also encourage employees to contact anyone within the company when they need to. They make it feel less hierarchical and encourage people to reach out for even CEO or founders. Because people at the front line see things differently than those higher ups, they know what's going on directly, it is important they have a voice and a direct way to communicate what they see to higher ups.

Employee just wanna get their job done alone, at the right time, etc. if people are fundamentally good. Managers' success depends on the other's successes, so they want to make sure it's good and start to micro-manage. But managers are employees too so they want to control below and be freedom up. Managers are there to make teams effective, just coach them, counsel them. They remove power from managers. They are not the ones deciding the team, the promotions, the salaries, hires, etc. The only thing left is "How can I help?" And they don't control and instead they guide and counsel. Slower to drive big changes.

Wide variation in pay is a good thing, power law distribution. Both salary and bonus and stock grant. We assume human performance is normally distributed. They say top people produce way more than the average, often by 90/95% of the value. If you pay people equally, the good ones will quit. Pay aggressively for high performer, but you need a system that is just and fair so you can honestly stand and say that's why they got that much and they moved up.

How to find most talented people. Started from constraint from the growth. How quickly can we hire? They went brute force first. More recruiters and get best schools and screen for smart. They couldn't recruit fast enough, hires weren't good enough, hiring became awful process, too many rounds, too complex.

They checked how many to tell whether to tell. They used to do 15 to 20 before figuring out, but found out that after 4 they knew already. They checked test scores, where you studied, but found out it doesn't really matter. None of that stuff matters, you can find great people anywhere.

Google looks for 4 attributes of people who have been successful at Google. General cognitive ability. Smart + learning + general problem solving. Emergent leadership, when you see a problem and step in and relinquish power. Googliness, conscienciousness. Intellectual humility, where you can revise you opinions from new facts. Les
