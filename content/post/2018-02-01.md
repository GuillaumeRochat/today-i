How do you take people and make them exceptional.

They say people are fundamentally good. They do better if they feel like it's theirs. Give them ownership. Being transparent about what happens and why. Weekly all hand and ask what's going on and get up to date. If it's yours, you should know what's going on with it.

They can even contact anyone within the company. They make it feel less hierarchical and encourage people to reach out for CEO or founders, it's all of theirs organizations. Because people at the front line see things differently than those higher ups. They know what's going on directly.

Employee just wanna get their job done alone, at the right time, etc. if people are fundamentally good. Managers' success depends on the other's successes, so they want to make sure it's good and start to micro-manage. But managers are employees too so they want to control below and be freedom up. Managers are there to make teams effective, just coach them, counsel them. They remove power from managers. They are not the ones deciding the team, the promotions, the salaries, hires, etc. The only thing left is "How can I help?" And they don't control and instead they guide and counsel. Slower to drive big changes.

Wide variation in pay is a good thing, power law distribution. Both salary and bonus and stock grant. We assume human performance is normally distributed. They say top people produce way more than the average, often by 90/95% of the value. If you pay people equally, the good ones will quit. Pay aggressively for high performer, but you need a system that is just and fair so you can honestly stand and say that's why they got that much and they moved up.
