In the chapter I read, he talks about memorizing a poem and why it is considered to be the most difficult part of the World Championship by most competitors. He talks about some other topics leading to that one, but the history behind poem memorization is the most interesting aspect.

They start by explaining how things were before writing even existed. Everything was transmitted orally and remembered. Memory was the most important thing to transmit information between generations. So much that there were many jobs that were targeting that very specific roles, such as remembering all the laws that existed. Poets were also part of that oral tradition. They could think of poems but couldn't write them down. Some even had memory specialist that would remember the poems they would think.

When we look at poems, we see a lot of abstractions, words we can't imagine, which makes them every difficult to remember. It's easy to remember an idea, it's difficult to remember the exact precise words. To understand how they used to remember poems, they took a loot at The Iliad and The Odyssey. Many critics claim they aren't very strong poems for masterpieces, with things such as always referring to a character with a quality at the same time, even when that quality is misplaced in the context, such as referring to a joyful character while that exact character is crying. Studies have however shown that those two poems are actually oral poems written down at some point. They had been remembered by several people, each potentially introducing small changes.
