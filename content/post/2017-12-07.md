... thought about packaging a NodeJS application as a single executable that would include NodeJS. Many different open source softwares are available to do that kind of thing.

The most known, [pkg](https://github.com/zeit/pkg) wasn't working when I tried it today. I would get stuck compiling the NodeJS version and not move from there. Then I tried [nexe](https://github.com/nexe/nexe) which didn't behave as I expected and I couldn't get it to actually build an working executable. I also found out about [enclose](https://github.com/igorklopov/enclose) and [node-packer](https://github.com/pmq20/node-packer) but didn't even try them out.

I thought about whether it would be nice to package a NodeJS application in a single executable. With that, we might be able to create a Docker container FROM scratch and include only the executable. It might also be useful in other kind of orchestration such as running the packaged software as a binary with [nomad](https://www.nomadproject.io/).

With languages such as Go and Rust, we end up compiling the software as a single executable that we can then package and run without any other external dependancies. Maybe the same thing could be achieved and it could have some advantages. If not for deployment, it can be useful for distribution of the software for non-technical users without exposing the whole structure and dependencies.
