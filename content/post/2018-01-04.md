... did too many things to write about a single one of them. I started the day by listening to [You 2.0: Dream Jobs on npr](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/31/540648577/you-2-0-how-to-build-a-better-job). On this episode, Amy Wrzesniewski talked about Job Craftmanship and how the way we see and describe our job affect how accomplished we feel doing it. She talked about [3 orientation: job, career or calling](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/career-transitions/201206/job-career-calling-key-happiness-and-meaning-work). I am wondering which calling fits my current situation the most, and I'm wondering if having a different concentration of each calling within a workplace has an impact on the overall success, and whether we can change people from a calling to another.

I also playing with Websockets using the [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) library. It was a breeze to setup the connection from the frontend to the backend. I also had a mock at the frontend that behaved the way I want the backend to behave, but in memory. Once the connection to the backend was working as expected, I was able to replace the frontend mock with the redirection to the backend and it worked right away, which is nice.

Then I moved on to save data on a json database, just to use as a mock for a kind of playground application. For that I used [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) which is a pretty amazing database handler. It basically has some adaptators to read JSON from different places and then wraps the JSON in [lodash](https://lodash.com/), and handles read/write from/to the files right away, without any manual file handling. It's the perfect way to easily do CRUD without having to setup a full RDBMS or NoSQL database.

Then, I listened to the [You 2.0: Embrace the Chaos episode on npr](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/07/542091224/you-2-0-why-disorder-may-be-good-for-us). In this episode, Tim Harford, author of the book [Messy](https://www.amazon.ca/Messy-Power-Disorder-Transform-Lives/dp/1594634793), explains how chaos can actually be beneficial in some situations. The concept here is not messy as in being careless but messy as in, given an unexpected situation, we have to figure out how to do something with what's given to us and it can cause us to generate new ideas and find new opportunities. Without a bit of chaos, we end up being in a routine, where we don't necessarily try to change things for the better. When that routine is forcibly broken, we have to figure out new ways to do things, which might end up better, but we wouldn't have known had we kept going in the routine.

Finally, I listened to a video from [Modular Landing about Modular Synths](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oBEZF2pAbMg). In that video, he explains the basic concepts of a modular synth and what's actually needed as the basic toolbox to create sounds. It is a very interesting video with some annoying noises at times, but it shows how voltage and waves can create very interesting patterns.
