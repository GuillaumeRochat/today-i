... did too many things to write about a single one of them. I started the day by listening to [You 2.0: Dream Jobs on npr](https://www.npr.org/2017/07/31/540648577/you-2-0-how-to-build-a-better-job). On this episode, Amy Wrzesniewski talked about Job Craftmanship and how the way we see and describe our job affect how accomplished we feel doing it. She talked about [3 orientation: job, career or calling](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/career-transitions/201206/job-career-calling-key-happiness-and-meaning-work). I am wondering which calling fits my current situation the most, and I'm wondering if having a different concentration of each calling within a workplace has an impact on the overall success, and whether we can change people from a calling to another.

I also playing with Websockets using the [Socket.io](https://socket.io/) library. It was a breeze to setup the connection from the frontend to the backend. I also had a mock at the frontend that behaved the way I want the backend to behave, but in memory. Once the connection to the backend was working as expected, I was able to replace the frontend mock with the redirection to the backend and it worked right away, which is nice.

Then I moved on to save data on a json database, just to use as a mock for a kind of playground application. For that I used [lowdb](https://github.com/typicode/lowdb) which is a pretty amazing database handler. It basically has some adaptators to read JSON from different places and then wraps the JSON in [lodash](https://lodash.com/), and handles read/write from/to the files right away, without any manual file handling. It's the perfect way to easily do CRUD without having to setup a full RDBMS or NoSQL database.

Then, I listened to the [You 2.0: Embrace the Chaos episode on npr](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/07/542091224/you-2-0-why-disorder-may-be-good-for-us).
