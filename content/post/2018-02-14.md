... listened to the [I'm Right, You're Wrong](https://www.npr.org/2017/12/25/572162132/enter-title) episode of the hidden brain podcast. In this episode, they talk with Tali Sharot, author of the book [The Influential Mind](https://www.amazon.com/Opinion-Others-Tali-Sharot/dp/1627792651).

The episode starts off by exploring actual political debates, such as vaccine and climate change. Often, one side of the debates comes with proof and data about its claim, and can't believe the other side isn't believing it although there are undeniable proofs. Usually, those debates involves one side being shown new data in the hope that it will change that person's opinion, yet it does not work.

Tali Sharot explains how the mind works and process information, from a neuroscientific point of view. Turns out that we actually are open to new data, only if it helps reinforcing our original belief. Whenever a contradicting data is show, we tend to dismiss it, assume it is invalid, etc. The thing is, that is usually the correct response most of the time. Most of the time, the new information is invalid, has no ground, and should be dismissed. The issue is that however, when the person holds a wrongful belief, it makes it much harder to change that person's mind.

Another issue is with how we weight opinions on a subject. Given 10 persons telling you the same thing, 5 saying the opposite, you'd believe the bigger number. That also holds true if we have 10 neophytes and 5 experts. We eight their opinions the same, even though the 5 experts should have much more weight in the decision.
