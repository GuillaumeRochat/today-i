... listened to the [Our Politics, Our Parenting](https://www.npr.org/2016/09/13/493615864/when-it-comes-to-our-politics-family-matters) episode of the Hidden Brain podcast. In this episode, they talk about the relation between politics and families. More specifically, how our view of the family impacts our political views.

They describe two basic models of parenting, the "strict father" and the "nurturing parent". George Lakoff describes the "strict father" as :

> The father knows best, the father knows right from wrong, and the job  of the father is not just to support and protect the family but also,  with respect to children, to teach them right from wrong so they have  the right moral views.
