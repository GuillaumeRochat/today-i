... need to write down some thoughts I have about licensing. It follows a post I read on Hacker News yesterday where they talked about paying for software. The discussion went around open source, and whether an open source software means less support for issues as opposed to paid software where the developer may or may not have more incentive to fix the issues, etc. Some of the points went toward open source licenses and how you could do open source while still making some money from either donations of from selling the support of the product.

Over the past years, one method that seem to be more and more popular for open source projects is to sell the hosting and support of the open source software, with some private extra, but still leave the software open sourced for everyone to use. That unfortunately only works for applications that need hosting. A music player could hardly fit that bill in comparison. One method to be able to sell and still keep the software open sourced was GPL.

I never really liked GPL because of my only relation with licenses, through libraries we use in private projects. Most of the time, we either see MIT or Apache licenses in libraries included in a project with tools such as cargo, yarn, composer, etc. It clearly does not make sens to create a library and make it GPL, because it will barely be used and updated. Most programmers are working on closed source projects and cannot therefore use GPL libraries.

However, GPL does make sens in other situations, when the open source project in question is not a library but a full on application. Then, it does make sens to make it GPL, so it prevents others from making changes to the software but closed source, and then making a profit on the initial developer's efforts without contributions. It leaves the original developer the opportunity to sell support or hosting for his software without risking theft from others, while still leaving those who wants to use it for personal use free to do so.

So in retrospect, there is a clear distinct line between libraries that should always be something other than GPL, and full software glueing a bunch of libraries, which should be GPL.

This brought an idea that I have had for quite some times. In the four years I've been working as a web application developer, I used a lot of open source libraries. They allowed me to make interesting applications in a very short amount of time. My employer always said how they are doing "open source" yet we rarely contribute. The few open source packages we have are so trivial and minimal that they don't require support and no one really
