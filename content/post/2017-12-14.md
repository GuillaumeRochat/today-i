... thought about the DeWitt clause and how it makes no sens that a clause like that would exist in the software world.

It would be as if car constructors prevented anyone from doing efficiency and security tests and review. Say company X decides that it is no longer legal to display information regarding the security of their vehicle, or the fuel efficiency. Then you have to choose the most economical vehicle and you know that car A is rated 1, car B is rated 2, and car C cannot have a public rating. Now, figure out which to choose.

It seems to be like that with software that have a DeWitt clause. There should be a third party that has no gain and would put stamps of approval on softwares that respect some criteria the industry believes in. Say, a service or library that has a good security level would have a stamp of approval. They could rate themselves and have a third party approve the rating.

If such thing existed (maybe it does and I haven't heard of it or realized that's what it is), then customers would start to go for the "Energy Star" equivalent of software, and those who do not abide by these rules would eventually have to.
