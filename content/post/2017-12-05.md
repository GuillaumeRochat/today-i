... read about key derivation functions. I was looking at secrets storage on production servers in general, when I ended up reading a bit more about KDF. I knew about [bcrypt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt) and that it currently is somewhat of a standard for password hashes. I also knew about some alternatives such as [PBKDF2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PBKDF2) and [Argon2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2) but never spent the time to learn the difference.

[This interesting post](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/6415) explains in a lot of details the differences between some of them. Turns out that bcrypt is considered better than PBKDF2 because it doesn't use SHA-* but instead uses Blowfish, which makes it stronger against brute force from GPUs, while PBKDF2 is more vulnerable to GPU brute force. It has to do with optimising the use of the hardware so that attackers cannot use the GPU as much.

The same thing was pushed a little more with [scrypt](http://www.tarsnap.com/scrypt.html) where the amount of RAM used was proportional to the processing required, but it also extended the process time by so much that in order to be usable, only weak usage was viable in terms of delays.

Finally, Argon2 seems to be quite recent to the party, being a winning entry at a Password Hashing Competition held in July 2015. It apparently is more promissing and secure than both bcrypt and PBKDF2, but it seems to still be a little too early to tell wether it will become more used.
