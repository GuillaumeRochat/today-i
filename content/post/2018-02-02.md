... started to build the same proof of concept I worked on already but using Go lang this time. As I never actually coded in Go, only read about it, I had to set up my environment before starting the proof of concept. Turns out there is plenty in terms of IDE and editor supports, so I was able to get up everything I needed from a single Atom plugin.

I already had the Go compiler installed locally so I didn't have to fiddle with that part. I simply created my directory in that GOPATH. I made sure I could compile a hello world and then checked for a websocket library. And that's when I figured how dependency management works in Go lang... There's none by default. As in, you check a Go lang project and try to figure out its dependencies... well, you'll have to read the source code.
