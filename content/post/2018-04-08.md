... tried a currying pattern in JavaScript. It was inspired from [Elm lang](http://elm-lang.org/) that has a very interesting way to handle functions which makes currying as easy as omitting parameters in a function call. Since I'm using JavaScript, I could have avoided the currying pattern I tried, but the point is also to try and ditch the classes and object oriented aspects of the language when not needed.

The way Elm lang handle functions, from what I remember from the only time I tried it, is that functions can only have 1 parameter internally, but when you define a function with multiple parameters, it's actually creating a function of a function of a function... Basically, when writing this first method, it is internally understood as this second method :

    // Elm function
    firstMethod param1 param2 param 3 =
        true
    
    // JavaScript equivalent
    function secondMethod(param1) {
        return function(param2) {
            return function(param3) {
                return true
            }
        }
    }

What that does it whenever you call the method in Elm lang, you call a method of a method of a method. Elm doesn't have parentheses for function calls and function signature, which doesn't create the same annoyance you get from this pattern in JavaScript.

    // Elm function call
    firstMethod 1 2 3
    
    // JavaScript equivalent
    secondMethod(1)(2)(3);

This concept isn't very clean to write in JavaScript, but what it does in Elm is you can easily curry any function by simply omitting a parameter. It makes currying very simple and powerful.

    let thirdMethod = firstMethod 1 2
    thirdMethod 3
    
    // is equivalent to
    
    firstMethod 1 2 3

I had to create methods that would require the database name. I could have gone the OO way and create a class that requires the database name in the constructor, but instead I went the functional way by currying methods and using another function to wrap that currying. It went to something like this.

    // service.js
    const database = require('./database');
    
    module.exports = database_name => {
    	add: database.add(database_name),
        update: database.update(database_name),
        delete: database.delete(database_name),
    };
    
    // database.js
    function add(database_name) {
        return data => {
        	// ...
        };
    }
    
    function update(database_name) {
        return data => {
        	// ...
        };
    }
    
    function delete(database_name) {
    	return data => {
        	// ...
        };
    }
    
    module.exports = { add, update, delete };
