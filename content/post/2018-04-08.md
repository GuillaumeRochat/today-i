... tried a currying pattern in JavaScript. It was inspired from [Elm lang](http://elm-lang.org/) that has a very interesting way to handle functions which makes currying as easy as omitting parameters in a function call. Since I'm using JavaScript, I could have avoided the currying pattern I tried, but the point is also to try and ditch the classes and object oriented aspects of the language when not needed.

The way Elm lang handle functions, from what I remember from the only time I tried it, is that functions can only have 1 parameter internally, but when you define a function with multiple parameters, it's actually creating a function of a function of a function... Basically, when writing this first method, it is internally understood as this second method :

    // Elm function
    firstMethod param1 param2 param 3 =
        true
    
    // JavaScript equivalent
    function secondMethod(param1) {
        return function(param2) {
            return function(param3) {
                return true
            }
        }
    }

What that does it whenever you call the method in Elm lang, you call a method of a method of a method. Elm doesn't have parentheses for function calls and function signature, which doesn't create the same annoyance you get from this pattern in JavaScript.

    // Elm function call
    firstMethod 1 2 3
    
    // JavaScript equivalent
    secondMethod(1)(2)(3);
