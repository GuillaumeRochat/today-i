... listened to the [Forgery](https://www.npr.org/2015/12/01/457232855/how-the-brain-tells-real-from-fake-from-fine-art-to-fine-wine) episode of the Hidden Brain podcast. In this episode, Noah Charney talks about art forgery, more specifically of paintings. He explains the motivations behind art forgery and explains it through the forgeries of Eric Hebborn.

Eric Hebborn did not succeed from his own artwork although he had some talent. At some point, he bought drawings at a flea market that looked like they were of value. He brought them to an art gallery which bought them for a little more than he paid for them. Eventually, he walked by the same art gallery and saw the same drawing on sale for a much higher value than what he was paid for. He felt he had been duped by the gallery and decided to get revenge and began his career as one of the best art forger there is.
