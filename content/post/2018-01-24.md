... read the Starbucks and the Habit of Success chapter from [The Power of Habit](https://www.amazon.com/Power-Habit-What-Life-Business/dp/081298160X) book by Charles Duhigg. In this chapter, they talk about the concept of [Willpower](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control).

In the 1960s, an experiment was conducted with children of about 4 years old who were exposed to a single marshmallow. They were told not to eat it and that they would get a second one if they succeeded. About 30% of the children did succeed. Several years later, they found those same children and checked how they were succeeding in life. The ones that succeeded were almost much more successful in general, studying more, achieving higher grades, being better in general. It demonstrated that willpower had a very important impact on people life.

By the 1980s, a theory emerged stating that willpower could be learned. It was believed to be a skill that could be taught. However, Mark Muraven wasn't agreeing that it was a skill. You can use a skill whenever once you've learned it, but willpower was different.

It lead to a study in which they placed a bowl of freshly baked cookies and a bowl of radish. They were telling some students to eat only the cookies, and some others to only eat the radish. After doing so for a while, they were then told they had to do a puzzle and could ring a bell once they were tired of trying. The group that had to eat radish did awfully worse than the group that had to eat the cookies. From that study, they concluded willpower wasn't a skill, but rather a limited resource we have over the course of a day, just like muscle.
