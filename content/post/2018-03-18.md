... listened to [The 'DNA approach' to trading with Bruce Vanstone](http://bettersystemtrader.com/the-dna-approach-to-trading-with-bruce-vanstone/) episode of the Better System Trader podcast. In this episode, they talk about the several good practices for trades and his methods.

One of the reason he explains for the type of trading he's doing is that he doesn't have much time to do trades and he searched for a method that could be good and require little time. As an academic, he searched for an academically proven method, which turns out to be based on momentum. I can be summed up to the fact that whatever is in an upward trend tend to stay in that upward trend. In opposition, whatever is in a downward trend then to stay in a downward trend. That kind of trade involves making decision maybe once a month to watch where things are at and update things. Other than that, it does not care for the short swings and focuses on the big picture.

He insists on the fact that a trading strategy should be rigorously validated through data and academic. For instance, if you have several rules in your strategy and making a 15% rate, and then you change something in the rules and make 16%. Has the rule been used by other people or is just a one time deal? Is the result reproducible? Is it academically credible? Was the change really what made the increase or did something else also happen? In fact, he insists that many of those questions should be answered before
