... learned about the DeWitt Clauses. It comes from [something that happened in 1983 at the University of Wisconsin](https://danluu.com/anon-benchmark/). David DeWitt, alongside Dina Bitton and Carolyn Turbyfill created a database benchmarking framework. One of the database included in the results was Oracle.

Being who he is, Larry Ellison, founder of Oracle, did not like the results and tried to get David DeWitt fired from the University. David DeWitt did not get fired, but he retaliated by banning Oracle from hiring Wisconsin grads.

Oracle then decided to add a clause to their EULA forbidding the publication of benchmarks. Many other companies followed over the years, and that clause became known as the DeWitt Clauses.

The DeWitt clauses have spread outside the databases world and have appeared in many other softwares, unfortunately. That means we have to choose the software we use with incomplete information. It's just one more reason to dislike Oracle.
